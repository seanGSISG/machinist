# Contributing

Machinist uses Go for the CLI, control plane, and workers, plus React and Vite
for the embedded browser interface.

Before starting a change, search existing issues and keep the scope focused. Do
not include credentials, private repository data, or sensitive task content.
Report vulnerabilities through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not a public issue.

## Setup

Install:

- Go 1.26.6
- Node.js 22.22.2 or a compatible newer release, plus npm
- Git
- `just` for repository shortcuts
- the agent CLI needed for any real execution checks

Build Machinist and its embedded frontend:

```sh
just build
```

The binary is written to `bin/machinist`.

## Checks

Run the complete project check before opening a pull request:

```sh
just check
```

CI separately proves that Go formatting is current without changing files,
runs `go vet`, runs the Go suite with the race detector on Linux and macOS,
tests and builds the frontend,
and builds one `bin/machinist` executable.

The frontend bundle under `internal/controlplane/web/dist` is embedded into the
Go binary but is not committed (only `dist/.gitkeep` is tracked, so a Go-only
build still compiles and serves a "web UI not built" page). Build it before
building a binary you intend to use:

```sh
cd internal/controlplane/web
npm ci
npm test
npm run build
```

## Dependency updates

Dependabot checks Go and npm dependencies each week and GitHub Actions each
month. Review upstream release notes and keep each manifest and lockfile in sync.

Workflow actions must use a full commit SHA followed by a version comment, for
example `owner/action@0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567 # v1.2.3`.
Do not replace a pinned SHA with a mutable tag.

## Pull requests

- Keep changes focused.
- Include tests for changed behavior.
- Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` when current boundaries or contracts change.
- Use Conventional Commit messages.
- Explain what was verified, including browser checks for UI work.
- Do not commit credentials, local configuration, databases, or run artifacts.

Changes to `main` must go through a pull request and pass the required `check`
status. By participating, you agree to follow the
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Contributions use the project's
[MIT License](LICENSE).
